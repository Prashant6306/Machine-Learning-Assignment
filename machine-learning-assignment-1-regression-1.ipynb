    "Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression are both statistical techniques used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The main difference between the two lies in the number of independent variables involved.\n",

    "Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a linear approach that involves only one independent variable to predict the value of the dependent variable. The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable is assumed to be a straight line.\n",
    "Example: Suppose we want to predict a person's salary based on their years of experience. Here, the dependent variable is the salary, and the independent variable is the years of experience. We collect data from a sample of individuals, record their salaries and corresponding years of experience, and then fit a line that best represents the relationship between the two variables. The simple linear regression model would be:\n",

Here, the dependent variable is the sale price, and the independent variables are the house size, number of bedrooms, and location (represented as dummy variables). We gather data on various houses, record their sale prices, sizes, number of bedrooms, and locations, and then develop a multiple linear regression model to estimate the house price. The multiple linear regression model would be:\n",

    "Sale Price = β₀ + β₁ * Size + β₂ * Number of Bedrooms + β₃ * Location\n",

    "In multiple linear regression, each independent variable is associated with a coefficient (β) that represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in that independent variable, while holding other variables constant.\n",

    "Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. There should be no correlation or dependency among the residuals or errors.\n",

    "Scatterplots: Create scatterplots of the dependent variable against each independent variable. If the points roughly form a straight line, it indicates linearity. Non-linear patterns may suggest violations of the linearity assumption.\n",

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the error or cost function of a model by iteratively adjusting the model's parameters. It is widely used in training models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of gradient descent can be understood as follows:\n",

    "Cost Function: In machine learning, a cost function or loss function is defined to measure the error between the predicted values of the model and the actual values in the training data. The goal is to minimize this cost function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Initialization: Start with initial values for the model's parameters.\n",

    "Calculate the Gradient: Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The gradient represents the direction and magnitude of the steepest increase in the cost function.\n",

    "Update Parameters: Adjust the parameters by taking a step in the opposite direction of the gradient. This step is determined by a learning rate, which controls the size of the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat: Iterate steps 2 and 3 until convergence criteria are met. Convergence occurs when the cost function reaches a minimum or when the parameter updates become small enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeatedly computing gradients and updating parameters, gradient descent gradually moves the model towards the optimal set of parameter values that minimize the cost function. The learning rate determines the step size, and finding an appropriate learning rate is crucial to ensure convergence and avoid overshooting or slow convergence.\n",

    "Gradient descent can be further categorized into different variations, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent, based on the size of the data used for each parameter update.\n",

    "Limited Data Range: If the available data is limited and the relationship between the variables appears non-linear, polynomial regression can provide a reasonable approximation within the observed range.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the choice between linear regression and polynomial regression depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the underlying relationship between the variables. Careful consideration of model performance, complexity, and the need for non-linear modeling is necessary to make an informed decision."
